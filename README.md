# OSINT 
It is a utility that brings together several tools to make osint to a certain objective.

The script is designed to be used in a simple way, just give it permission and execute it.

```bash
[1] Technology
[2] DNS Enum
[3] Metadata
[4] People
[5] Employees
[6] Recon
[7] Delete All files
[8] Exit
Choose an option: 
```

This menu allows you to choose and later everything is saved in a file to analyze it later.

## Dependencies

For the issue of dependencies it is simpler because the script itself makes checks.
The only dependency to take into account is sherlock.
